# MATLAB Expert Tips

## What is the repo about? :interrobang:
This repo provides examplary MATLAB live scripts for advanced techniques in MATLAB programming. Please note, the repo does not cover broader programming, software design, or architectural principles. It consists of 13 sections.

## Who should use the repo? :raising_hand:
Primary audience consists of engineers without a deep software background that aim to leverage the MATLAB language in their daily work.

## What are the prerequisites? :pencil2:
- MATLAB instance to run live scripts
- Familiarity with MATLAB and knowledge about basic data types


## What will you learn? :books:
- Write more readable and maintainable code
- Understand data types and asses the use cases
- Investigate inner workings of the language to solve daily problems
- Produce expert-level documentation
